This directory contains the data of the course work analysis "Characterization of Ossetian honeybee metagenome".

The .rmd file contains the entire analysis code

The table directory contains the tables:
- Characterization of samples
- Intermediate estimate of the number of remaining reads
- Table of obtained ASV
- Core microbiome relative abundance
- Table of belonging to clusters, obtained using the k-means method
- Table of alpha diversity
- Table of plant community

The directory with graphs contains:
- Map with sampling locations
- Map with approximation of phytocenoses of points for which the analysis of the relationship of microorganisms with the floristic composition was carried out
- Plot of rarefication of reads
- Plot of the number of remaining reads
- Plot of differences between the microbiome of an average bee and the bee intestine
- Heat map of normalized CLR by transformation of data on the representation of microorganisms
